We first create our solid block of tiles adhering to the dimensions laid out in our server configuration file.

This solid block is then immediately serialized to disk, after which we begin etching out pieces of the world.

Typically the first "zones" will be created first, after which the rest of the map is generated (if necessary) or "etched", and saved as worldgen progresses.

We want to launch logs of these worldgen events, and we want to set a global flag indicating that worldgen is complete.

If a player logs in while a zone hasn't been unloaded or generated yet, priority is given to that zone and the player is not allowed to zone-in until that map is ready for them to join.

NOTES -

* We DO NOT destroy Tiles, we modify the existing objects. 
* Do NOT pass around Tile addresses, pass references to the objects.
* Modifications to a Tile are done through the Tilemap Interface
* We never talk to a Tile directly, we always use the Tilemap Interface.
