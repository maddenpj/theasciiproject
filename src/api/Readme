API -

    This directory holds files related to API calls that the server handles.

    Notice that there are several levels of "API" calls, those that are meant for
    Players/Admins, those that are meant for the "web" API interface for keeping our
    "Server Status" page working properly, and those that are meant for use on the
    Server console itself.
