Mapping -

This directory holds files related to various levels of maps.

EntityMap, TileMap, WorldMap, etc.

These files don't allow entities to modify the attributes of Maps
The functions that allow entities to modify Tiles are in the
"interaction" directory.

You may also want to look at the "worldgen" directory for files
related to how our maps are built before being added into the
GlobalMapIndex.
